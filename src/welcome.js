                <p>Pick a place amidst the rows of  crocuses and tulips* or among the plethora of succulents or in the shade of our ivy-decorated arches, take a sit, breathe in the air filled with flowery aromas 
                ...and enjoy our wonderful selection of breads, buns and pies.</p>
                <p>We advise you to order a cup of coffee made with freshly roasted Arabica beans, or try our teas: black, green, white, fruity, you name it.</p>
